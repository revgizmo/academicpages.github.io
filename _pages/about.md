I'm a Strategy Focused Data Science Leader

I am currently a graduate student in the Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) program at UC Berkeley, formalizing my education in hard data science (machine learning, AI, etc.) to add to my analytics and project management experience. I am looking for an intellectually stimulating position where I can share the wealth.

* I get a rush out of looking at messy business problems, coming up with clear questions, and then finding the answers in the (inevitably messy and unorganized) data. 

* I like helping data/IT people understand business needs and helping business people make data-based decisions. Sometimes that means getting into the weeds of the data, other times that means strategic planning at a higher level. Either way, I enjoy mentoring teams, finding solutions to hard problems, and delivering on time and under budget.

* I am a fan of the Six Sigma DMAIC framework a method to think through process improvements and product launches, and surfacing insights from data through good questions. 

* Iâ€™m especially a fan of R and the benefits of reproducible research.
